# 👋 Hey, I'm Phobia

I’m a Game Developer specializing in scripting, UI design, and game security.  
Since 2019, I’ve been building systems, interfaces, and scalable frameworks for Roblox experiences, with a strong focus on performance, exploit prevention, and secure game design.  

---

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Roblox Lua Scripting**
- **UI/UX Design** (functional, clean, and immersive interfaces)  
- **Game Security & Protection**
  - Remote security & validation  
  - Anti-crash methods and exploit resistance  
  - Secure client/server communication  

I also have experience on the exploit development side, having created tools like the phobia.ml crash panel (multi-crash method panel) as well as Dolphin Serverside.  
This dual perspective gives me deep insight into how to build stronger protections and countermeasures for Roblox games.
