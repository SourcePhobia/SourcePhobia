# 👋 Hey, I'm Phobia

I’m a **Game Developer** specializing in **scripting**, **UI design**, and **game security research**.  
Since **2019**, I’ve been building systems, interfaces, and scalable frameworks for Roblox experiences, with a strong focus on **performance, exploit prevention, and secure game design**.  

---

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Roblox Lua Scripting** (combat systems, data stores, anti-cheat, gameplay mechanics)  
- **UI/UX Design** (functional, clean, and immersive Roblox interfaces)  
- **Game Security & Protection**
  - Remote security & validation  
  - Anti-crash methods and exploit resistance  
  - Secure client/server communication  

I also have experience on the **exploit development side**, having created tools like the **phobia.ml crash panel** (multi-crash method panel).  
This dual perspective gives me deep insight into how to **build stronger protections and countermeasures** for Roblox games.
